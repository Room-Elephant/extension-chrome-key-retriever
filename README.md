# 🐶 Description
Tired of scavenging daily your dev console for your most used keys? Look no further! With Key Retriever extension, you're just one click away from accessing your most important session, local, or cookie storage keys.

Say goodbye to console struggles! Choose and add your keys to Key Retriever, and watch the magic unfold. Easily view, copy, or modify their values, all without sifting through the dev console chaos.

Oh, and there's more! No more JSON digging for a single key - Key Retriever lets you map those sub keys directly. And for those pesky unreadable names, don't fret! Give them aliases for a clear understanding of what each key represents.
